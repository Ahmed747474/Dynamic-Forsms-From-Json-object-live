# Trufla Dynamic Forms Task

 
## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
https://github.com/Ahmed747474/task.git
cd task
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on  `http://localhost:4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
